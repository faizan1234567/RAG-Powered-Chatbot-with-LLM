History and Establishment
The School of Interdisciplinary Engineering & Sciences (SINES) was established at NUST in
2007 to set up modeling and simulation facilities for design and development in various
disciplines through education, training and research. The center was founded to act as a
platform to integrate design and development efforts by the government, academia and
industry. Progress in this direction could only be made through cross-disciplinary research and
educational programmes in collaboration with industry and government. Specifically, there was
a need for integrating analytical and computational techniques with advances in computer
hardware and software.
SINES started its first MS programme in Computational Science and Engineering in Fall 2008,
with specializations in “Fluid Flow and Structures” and “Computational Infrastructures and
Visualisation”.
In Fall, 2010, the programme was extended to PhD in Computational Science and Engineering.
During the first four years, the educational and research programmes at SINES grew on the
foundation of ten interrelated thrust areas, each focusing on mathematical modeling and

simulation of a particular domain: structures; fluids; electrical systems; communication systems;
computer and network architecture; operations research; and human behavior. In 2011,
computational biology and drug design were added as new concentration areas both in MS and
PhD.
In 2012, a Centre of Excellence titled ‘Super Computing Research and Education Center
(SCREC)’ was established at SINES. SCREC houses a supercomputing facility and is presently
being utilized in computation-intensive research projects in the areas of fluid dynamics and
biosciences.
Recently, the education, training and research activities have been divided into two main
streams or departments, namely: Sciences; and Engineering. These departments have been
further divided into divisions to keep the activities focused, better managed as well as
synergised. Sciences comprises Computer Science, Bioinformatics, and Computational &
Applied Mathematics. Similarly, the Engineering division is divided into Engineering Sciences,
Systems Engineering and Operations Research.

Message from the Principal
It is both an honor and privilege to warmly welcome you to the School of Interdisciplinary

strengths making it one of the best research centers. We believe that the opportunity for higher
education should be available to all who seek it, and we will continue to meet the ongoing
challenges that higher education presents in the years ahead. Our students are provided with
the academic tools, practical skills, and “real world” opportunities necessary to advance as
leaders in their professions and their communities. I have a great belief in the capacity and
potential of our students and the wider community to come together. We encourage active
participation in an education that challenges critical thinking, provides career preparation, instills
values, and inspires lifelong learning. We realize that each student is unique and, as a
community, we strive to maximize that unique potential.
This academic year, we will continue our many efforts to make the educational and research
program ever stronger and more meaningful. It is indeed an exciting opportunity for you to join
at this time as we are in the midst of a new regime that is driving the research center towards
genuine high expectations and excellence which will permeate every aspect of SINES. We are

Adoption of a Performance Evaluation Technique for the Development of a Framework for the
Climatic Responsive Urban Design (CRUD)
PI: Dr Salma Sherbaz
Research studies on urban microclimate are gaining popularity due to recent climate changes
and rapid urbanization. Streets are the basic elements of a complex urban-built environment
and are usually considered of simple rectangular shape, commonly known as the ‘‘urban
canyon” (UC). The street orientation and geometry significantly affect wind and heat distribution
inside an urban street canyon, affecting the building’s energy performance and natural and
hybrid ventilation efficiencies. It also affects pedestrian comfort, pollutant dispersion, and overall
air quality at the street level. So for climatologists and designers, the knowledge of flow
characteristics in street canyons is an important consideration for Climate-responsive urban
design. This research aims to guide the designer in the early-stage climate-responsive urban
design. The project is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 11:
Sustainable Cities and Communities and SDG 11: Climate Action.
In-depth analysis of prediction and forecasting of sepsis in ICU patients using Deep Learning
PI: Dr Mehak Rafiq
Sepsis is a life-threatening reaction to an infection. Using AI to predict sepsis about 4-6hrs
earlier than doctors. This project will help to avoid complications due to sepsis in ICU. Moreover,
with the help of this project, we can extend good care in rural and unprivileged areas. Using
machine learning models to evaluate heterogeneity in sepsis treatment patterns contained
within granular data of electronic health records and to forecast sepsis using minimum features
to help accurately predict the onset of sepsis a minimum of 4-6 hours earlier. The project is
aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote
well-being for all at all ages
